# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: July 13, 2025

Thank you for using the IfunnyBot Discord bot.

## Data Collection

This bot does not collect, store, or share any personal data or user information. It does not log messages, usernames, user IDs, server IDs, or any other identifying information. All processing occurs in memory and is ephemeral.

## Data Usage

Since no data is collected, no data is used or shared with third parties.

## Third-Party Services

IfunnyBot may fetch content from third-party services (such as [iFunny](https://ifunny.co)) solely to display media within Discord. These requests are not tied to any specific Discord user and no user-identifiable information is shared with these services.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy

IfunnyBot does not knowingly collect any personal information from users, including those under the age of 13. Since the bot does not collect data at all, it complies with COPPA by default.
